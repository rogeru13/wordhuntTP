Title: 
Better Word Hunt

This program is a word connection game where users must connect English words on a randomly generated board. This board is customizable by size, and every round a timer is set and the user must find as many words as they can to achieve the highest score. There are a variety of different features for the user to experiment with, including a scoring system, a customizable board, a hint button, a functional scrollbar, and an animated backtracking tutorial board. 

Run Instructions:
